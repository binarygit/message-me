# Message-me!

Message-me is a fun little project. It's a realtime chatapp built using **_only_** Ruby on Rails.

Here's the live version, just login and start chatting!

## Motivation

I decided to build this because I wanted to experiment with real time features. I wanted to know how difficult it was to built something snappy and realtime staying inside the Rails ecosystem. It turns out it's really easy!

The tools involved in making it realtime are:

1. [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/)
2. [Stimulus Reflex](https://docs.stimulusreflex.com/)

That's it.

I also wanted to improve my testing skills and increasing myI did read that familiarity with `sidekiq`, and I wanted to learn to use View Components!

### Todo
1. Use View Components to show user cards.
2. Implement voice chat.
